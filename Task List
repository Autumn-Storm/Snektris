--------------------Verification Needed------------------------

Verify Color selection
  https://ee-programming-notepad.blogspot.com/2016/10/16-bit-color-generator-picker.html

-----------------------In Progress----------------------------

  Assign all blocks on screen a number value in a 2D Array (x,y)
  
  Assign all bocks a function in the 2D array (banner, boarder, play area, old tetris blocks as 1, 2, 3etc)

---------------------------TO DO-------------------------------

setup_game() function: 
  draw block color depending on how it was assigned (boarder = 1 = brown, for example)

setup_snake() function:
  Update to accomidate the array play area layout

move_snake() function:
  Update to accomidate the array play area layout

Possible function:
  Switch between snake and tetris game mode

move_tetris()
  Needs to go whenever user presses button (interrupt?)
  set up with new array play area layout
  
Fall_tetris()
  Needs to fall every 1 second - kind of taken care of in main
  Set up with new array play area layout
  
 Misc:
  Check timing of usleep() functions to make sure they are accurate. I am not sure if system is running at 50 MHz or 10 MHz off of the PLL
  
  Track location of old tetris blocks
  
  Redraw old tetris blocks
  
  Check if tetris block created a complete row
  
  Remove row
  
  #define colors
